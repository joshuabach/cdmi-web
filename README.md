CDMI Web
========

Simple Web Interface for CDMI
- Supports browsing of CDMI containers and changing capabilities for containers and dataobjects
- Limited write access to CDMI sites that support it (create directories, upload files or delete directories and files)
  - Via WebDAV
  - Via local FS access (useful in combination with a NFS mount or similar)
  
Note
====
This was intended as a one-time-use demo,
which can be seen by the lack of documentation
as well as some of the more quick-and-dirty approaches in the code
